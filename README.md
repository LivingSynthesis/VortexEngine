## Vortex Engine
This is a firmware for a custom arduino based gloveset

### Installation
In order to get started first you'll need to set up Arduino IDE
Download the latest version of the program for your operating system here
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 

### Setup 
Next we'll need to configure Arduino to work with our hardware!
The board we're using is called the Trinket m0 by Adafruit, and they have a fantastic guide on how to set up Arduino to support it. Just make sure to use the reccomended board versions below.

You will need to select the following board to install, make sure to select the correct version

##### Adafruit SAMD Boards v1.7.7

Newer versions have issues and do not work.

### Library Setup
Lastly we need to copy the libraries folder to the directory C:\Users\YourPCName\Documents\Arduino
This should give arduino everything it needs to work with the Vortex Gloves!
